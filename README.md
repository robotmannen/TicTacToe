# TicTacToe

## Introduction
Welcome to my TicTacToe Java Console App repository! This project was created as a personal learning endeavor to explore the basics of Java. TicTacToe game is a classic two-player game where the objective is to get three X's or O's in a row on a 3x3 grid. 

## How to Play
To play the game, you can simply clone project and run it from your IDE. The program will prompt the first player to make a move by inputting their desired row and column numbers. The board will update to display the move and the next player will be prompted to make their move. The game will continue until one of the players gets three in a row or if there is a stalemate.

## Restarting the Game
If you would like to play again, simply restart the program. At this time, there is no option to restart the game within the console, but this functionality may be added in the future.

Thank you for checking out this project!
